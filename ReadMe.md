🧠 CourseIQ — Class-Specific AI Teaching Assistant
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System for Course-Exclusive Knowledge


📘 Overview

CourseIQ is an AI-powered Teaching Assistant built specifically for students of a single course.
Unlike generic AI tools, CourseIQ knows only what the class knows — it is trained exclusively on the course’s materials such as slides, Canvas resources, PDFs, and lecture notes.

It is designed to:
- Help students understand class concepts faster.
- Guide them toward relevant course references instead of giving direct answers.
- Prevent academic dishonesty, ensuring AI support without compromising learning integrity.
- CourseIQ essentially acts as a smart, context-aware TA that lives inside the class ecosystem.


🎯 Project Motivation & Objectives

Modern AI tools (like ChatGPT) can easily provide ready-made answers — often beyond course scope — making it difficult for educators to ensure fair learning.
This project was built to counter that, with three clear goals:

Bounded Knowledge:
CourseIQ only accesses the instructor’s provided materials. No external data or web access.

Guided Learning, Not Cheating:
If a student asks a question resembling an exam or assignment (short factual or numerical query), CourseIQ does not answer directly — instead, it offers conceptual hints and class-based references.

Human-Like Assistance:
It emulates how a teaching assistant would respond — offering hints, clarifications, and citations rather than spoon-fed solutions.
